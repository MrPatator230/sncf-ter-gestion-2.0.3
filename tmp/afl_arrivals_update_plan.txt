Detailed Comparison and Update Plan for AFL Arrivals (arrivees.js) based on AFL Departures (departs.js)

Information Gathered:
- Both files have similar structure and functionalities: fetching schedules, filtering by type/day/time, sorting, pagination, status badges, and UI layout.
- Differences:
  - Filtering: arrivals.js filters by 'arrivals' type and arrivalStation; departs.js filters by 'departures' type and departureStation.
  - Status badge colors differ (green for arrivals, blue for departures).
  - The "via" stations are shown before gare in arrivals.js (Provenance) and after gare in departs.js (via).
  - Pagination dots size and header font size differ slightly.
  - Some minor differences in error/loading/no schedules messages aria-labels and text.
  - The logic for determining if last 4 schedules are displayed is present in departs.js but not used in arrivals.js.
  - The toggle for showing status text alternates every 2 seconds in both.
  - The schedule slicing for pagination is similar but arrivals.js always shows 2 dots, departs.js conditionally shows the second dot.
  - The track assignment display is similar.

Plan:
- Add the isLastFourSchedules function and use it in arrivals.js to control pagination display logic as in departs.js.
- Adjust pagination dots display in arrivals.js to conditionally show the second dot only if schedules length >= 4, like in departs.js.
- Review and unify aria-labels and messages for consistency.
- Ensure the toggle for showing status text is consistent.
- Verify and align any minor UI or logic differences found.
- Keep the color scheme and "via" stations logic as is, since they are appropriate for arrivals.
- Test the updated arrivals.js to confirm functionalities match departures.js.

Dependent Files to Edit:
- pages/afficheurs/afl/arrivees.js

Followup Steps:
- Implement the above changes.
- Test arrivals AFL page.
- Confirm with user if further enhancements are needed.

Please confirm if I can proceed with implementing this update plan.
